# multi-platoon-reconfiguration
The simulation results for platoon driving in the multi-platoon reconfiguration scenario. From top to bottom, the figures display: (a) the vehicle position trajectories, illustrating the reconfiguration of multiple platoons into a single unified structure; (b) the longitudinal position over time; (c) the lateral position over time; (d) the norm of the tracking error between two adjacent vehicles; (e) the norm of the tracking error between the $i$-th following vehicle and the leading vehicle; (f) the longitudinal velocity of each vehicle; (g) the lateral velocity of each vehicle; (h) the acceleration of each vehicle; and (i) the steering angle of each vehicle.
